### ℹ️ About

> **jellify** (verb) - *to make gelatinous* <br>
[see also](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jellify)

*Jellify* is a free and open source music player for [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/). Built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), *Jellify* provides a user experience that feels familar to other popular music apps and a has featureset to match

> *Jellify* requires a connection to a [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) server to work.

### 🤓 Background
I was after a music app for Jellyfin that showcased my music with artwork, had a user interface congruent with what the big guys do, and had the ability to algorithmically curate music (not that you have to use *Jellify* that way). I also wanted to create a music app that could handle my extremely large music libraries (i.e., 100K+ songs) and not get bogged down. 

This app was designed with me and my dad in mind, since I wanted to give him a sleek, one stop shop for live recordings of bands he likes (read: the Grateful Dead). The UI was designed so that he'd find it instantly familiar and useful. CarPlay / Android Auto support was also a must for us, as we both use CarPlay religiously. 

**TL;DR** Designed to be lightweight and scalable, *Jellify* caters to those who want a mobile Jellyfin music experience similar to what's provided by the big music streaming services.
